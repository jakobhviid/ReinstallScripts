# Getting Started with Mac

Install Homebrew using the command below, or follow the latest instructions from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Go to the folder for your machine and run `brew bundle`. This will import all the applications described, including applications from the App Store.

To create a new Brewfile run `brew bundle dump`.

For more instructions on export and import of applications using Homebrew, see [this guide](https://tomlankhorst.nl/brew-bundle-restore-backup/).
